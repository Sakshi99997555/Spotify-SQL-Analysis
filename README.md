# Spotify-SQL-Analysis

Spotify SQL Analysis Project ðŸŽµ

Overview
This project showcases an in-depth analysis of Spotify's dataset using SQL.
It focuses on extracting actionable insights through basic, intermediate, 
and advanced queries, demonstrating the power of structured query language in
analyzing large datasets for business intelligence.

Project Highlights
Data Extraction & Cleaning: Retrieved and filtered relevant information from multiple tables.

Aggregation & Insights: Leveraged SQL functions like SUM, AVG, COUNT, and GROUP BY for summarization.

Advanced Analysis: Used window functions, ranking, and conditional logic to explore deeper relationships in the data.

Optimization: Ensured high performance through indexing and query refinement.

Features

Basic Queries:

Identified tracks with over 1 billion streams.

Associated albums with their respective artists.

Analyzed licensed content and user engagement metrics.

Segmented tracks by album type (single vs. others).

Counted tracks produced by each artist.

Intermediate Queries:

Calculated average danceability by album to reveal musical trends.

Ranked top 5 high-energy tracks suitable for dynamic playlists.

Linked official videos with views and likes for engagement analysis.

Summarized total views by album to assess collective popularity.

Compared streaming performance on Spotify and YouTube.

Advanced Queries:

Ranked top 3 tracks per artist based on views using window functions.

Highlighted tracks with above-average liveness scores.

Measured energy variability within albums.

Analyzed energy-to-liveness ratios for unique music profiles.

Computed cumulative likes ordered by views to understand user approval.

Dataset

The dataset includes Spotify track information, such as:
Track streams
Album details
Danceability and energy metrics
Engagement parameters (likes, views, comments)
Tools & Techniques

SQL Features:
Basic commands: SELECT, WHERE, JOIN

Aggregate functions: SUM, AVG, COUNT

Window functions: RANK, CUME_SUM

Conditional logic: CASE

Optimization: Indexing, subqueries

SQL Environment: The analysis was performed using an SQL-based tool, ensuring accurate and efficient query execution.

Key Insights

Basic Queries

Popularity trends were highlighted by identifying tracks with massive streams.

Artist productivity was measured, with prolific contributors standing out.

Licensed content had higher audience engagement.

Intermediate Queries

Danceability trends were revealed at the album level.

High-energy tracks were pinpointed for targeted playlist creation.

Official video availability correlated with higher engagement metrics.

Advanced Queries

Ranked top-performing tracks for each artist.

Tracks with a live atmosphere were identified.

Variability in musical energy across albums highlighted artist creativity.

Future Scope
Expand the analysis to include sentiment analysis of lyrics.
